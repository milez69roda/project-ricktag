<div class="midascontainer"><h1>Midas&reg; Rewards Program Offered by Ricktag&reg; <br/>Network Solutions Inc.</h1>
<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

<h2>Program Overview</h2>
<ol style="padding-left: 10px;">
<li>The Midas&reg;Rewards Program (the "Program") is a loyalty reward program offered by Ricktag&reg; Network Solutions Inc. ("Ricktag", "us", "our" or "we") to customers of Midas (the "Stores" or each individually a "Store") and online at <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a>.

1. The Program allows persons who have completed the membership enrolment steps in accordance with the present Terms and Conditions and who have been issued a Midas Rewards Card (the "Program Members" or "Members") to collect Midas points when making purchases in-stores on items identified from time to time by Midas ("Eligible Purchases"), and to redeem these Midas Points for rewards, benefits and/or rebates offered by Midas and Ricktag Merchant Partners.

Ricktag may designate from time to time, Merchant Partners from whom Members will be able to collect or redeem Ricktag Points in the Program (the "Program Partners" or "Partners").

Members acquire no vested right or entitlement to the continued availability of any particular reward or benefit, Program Partner or redemption level.</li>
<h2>Participation in the Program</h2>
<h2>Membership Enrolment</h2>


<li>Membership is free and no initial purchase is required in order to become a Member.</li>
<li>To enroll, you must have a valid Canadian address and be 16 years of age or older. At a minimum, you must provide your first name, last name, and a valid email address. If you do not have a valid email address, you must provide a valid mailing address and phone number. You may also be asked to provide data such as gender or preferred language during the sign-up process. Only one Midas rewards account ("Midas Rewards Account" or "Account") is permitted per person.</li>
<li>Only one loyalty program account (i.e. one Midas Rewards Account) is permitted per person</li>
<li>To become a Member, simply ask a Store employee to sign you up or visit <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a> and complete the online form. To become a valid Member, you must complete the enrolment process by providing complete and accurate information and indicating your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. You may be required to register your account to complete the enrolment process within a defined period of time before Midas Points are awarded to your Account.</li>
<li>After completion, you will receive a Midas rewards member number ("Member Number"). If you sign up in-store, you will be given a card with a unique Member Number (the "Midas Rewards Card" or the "Card"). </li>
<li>The Midas Rewards Card is not a credit card. The Card is the property of Ricktag and it may be revoked at any time by Ricktag in the event of breach of the Terms and Conditions of the Program by a Member, misuse or abuse of the Program by a Member, fraud, and/or any other actions deemed by Ricktag to be contrary to the Program or the interests of its Members or Partners.</li>
<li>Members cannot share their account number and account information with anyone else. Membership benefits apply only to the individual Midas Rewards Account holder. Account information, including, but not limited to, the Midas Rewards Account password should be protected and kept secure.</li>
<li>You must advise us immediately of any changes of Personal Information (as defined herein) including name, address, and e-mail address either by visiting <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a> or emailing us at customerservice@ricktag.ca. Ricktag shall not be liable for misdirected email or mail communications, including any notices under these Terms and Conditions or any consequences thereof where your Personal Information is inaccurate or no longer valid. If we believe that some of our records are inaccurate, we may contact you to verify our records. We reserve the right to cancel any Account for which we have incomplete or inaccurate Personal Information and all points redemptions on that Account may be blocked and any points awarded may be forfeited. The submission of false or fictitious Personal Information will result in all the Midas Points accumulated on an Account being forfeited.</li>
<li>Midas reserves the right to refuse issuance of an Account to any person who does not follow the prescribed enrolment procedures.</li>
<li>Midas rewards membership is only available to individuals. Midas rewards membership will not be available to corporations, businesses, charities, partnerships, enterprises, schools or anyone other than an individual, unless written approval is received in advance from Midas, in its sole discretion. Midas Points will not be awarded if in Midas's reasonable opinion the merchandise purchased will be used for resale or commercial use and any Midas Points awarded on such purchases will be forfeited. If a Midas rewards Member was awarded points for an offer or promotion in which a Member purchased product in excess of reasonable quantities, the Midas Points awarded as a result of that offer or promotion may be forfeited without prior notice and the Account may be suspended or closed.</li>
<li>If for any reason we believe a Member is under the age of 16, we reserve the right to request proof of age. If such proof is not provided, all Personal Information regarding that individual may be deleted from our system and the Membership may be terminated, including the immediate forfeiture of all Midas points.</li>


<h2>Collection of plum Points</h2>


<li>To collect Midas Points following enrolment, you must make Eligible Purchases in-store by presenting your personal valid Midas Rewards Card. Any unauthorized reproduction of the Midas Rewards Card may lead to legal prosecution and forfeiture of all Midas Points and membership in the Program.<br/>
<strong>At Cash, In-store</strong>: The Member's personal Midas Rewards Card must be presented to the cashier before the Eligible Purchase transaction is completed.</li>
<li><strong>Online:</strong>  Midas Points will not be issued for every dollar spent online. However, from time to time, bonus Midas Points may be awarded for purchases made online, as advertised by Ricktag on <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a> and/or in-stores. Also, Members can be, from time to time, eligible to receive a "Member Discount" on any participating Ricktag Merchants, as advertised by Ricktag from time to time at http://<a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a></li>
<li>Midas Points may be awarded retroactively if the original receipt and your Midas Rewards Card is produced in-stores within 14 days of the date of the original Eligible Purchase.</li>
<li>Midas Points will be awarded at the rate of 5% Midas Points for each dollar spent on Eligible Purchases. Midas Points will be calculated by reference to the net (Eligible Purchase price less discounts) pre-tax total on each cash register receipt. Midas may offer special promotions from time to time offering additional Midas Points("bonus Midas points"). Such bonus Midas points, once awarded, shall form part of the Member's Midas Points balance (the Midas Points and bonus Midas Points collectively referred to as "Midas Points").</li>
<li>All Midas Points awarded for an Eligible Purchase as well as the Member's current Midas Points balance can be found in you're My Account page at <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a>. In the event of a discrepancy our internal database and records will govern.<br /><br />
Occasionally, through specified promotions by participating Stores and/or Program Partners, additional Midas Points(and/or other rewards or benefits) may be awarded for using the Midas Rewards Card, or for being a Member.
</li>
<li>Midas's standard Return/Exchange Policy applies. In the event of a return/exchange of any Eligible Purchase, Midas Points will be deducted automatically from the Account that was used for the Eligible Purchase (whether or not the Midas Rewards Card is presented at the time of return and/or exchange). </li>
<li>All Midas Points totals, will be deemed correct unless otherwise substantiated by the Member by bringing forward evidence satisfactory to Midas. In the case of a discrepancy, our internal database and records govern. Discrepancies must be addressed with the Ricktag Customer Service Centre within three months of the date on which the discrepancy occurred. Midas reserves the right to restrict redemption or put a "hold" on Midas Points for up to 90 days from the date the points are posted to an Account if Ricktag has reasonable belief that fraud has occurred or in the event of a breach or suspected breach of the Terms and Conditions of this Program.</li>
<li>Midas Points are not transferable from one Member to another. Midas may, however, in its sole discretion allow the transfer of Midas Points in accordance with the "transfer points" terms and conditions posted from time to time at <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a></li>
<li>Midas Points are reduced to zero upon closure of a Midas rewards membership.</li>
<li>Upon the death of a Member, the Member's account will be closed and any Midas Points in the account will be forfeited. Midas Points are not divisible in the case of divorce.</li>
<li>Should any Member not collect Midas Points using a Midas Rewards Card or redeem Midas Points for 14 consecutive calendar months, the membership will be deemed to be inactive and all accumulated Midas Points will be forfeited. If a Member's only activity in 14 consecutive calendar months consists of transferring points under any Midas promotion in existence from time to time, the membership will be deemed inactive and all accumulated Midas Points will be forfeited.</li>

<h2>Redemption of Points</h2>

<li>(a) Midas Points may be redeemed for rewards consisting of a predetermined dollar discount reward off a purchase in-store, in accordance with the Midas Points redemption schedule in force on the date when the Midas Points are redeemed by the Member ("Redemption Transaction"). <br />
The following redemption schedule is provided for illustrative purposes only. The updated Midas Points redemption schedule in effect from time to time is available at <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a><br /><br />

  <span style="font-size:10px">2500 points is the minimum amount of points needed to start redeeming up to a <br />
maximum of 25,000 points in a single transaction. Not to be combined with other offers.</span>
</div>
<br /><br />
Points will not be awarded on the portion of the Redemption Transaction paid for by redemption of Midas points. From time to time, special promotions may be run during which one or more redemption level(s) may temporarily be altered and/or suspended, new redemption levels added or points may be redeemed directly towards the purchase of specific products or services. Promotions may vary from Store to Store and online.
(b) Ricktag may, from time to time, offer supplementary programs, rewards, benefits or promotions related to the Midas rewards program. 
</li>
<li>In accordance with Federal and Provincial tax legislation, GST, PST, HST and any other applicable taxes are calculated and payable by the Member on the full amount of the purchase price of the item subject to a dollar discount reward during a Redemption Transaction.</li>
<li>Subject to section 29, a Member's Midas Points balance will be reduced by the number of points required to obtain the desired point redemption level. Unredeemed Midas Points plus any Midas Points awarded in the current Redemption Transaction will remain in the Member's Midas Rewards Account and can be applied to a subsequent Redemption Transaction</li>
<li>Midas Points can only be redeemed if the required point redemption level is acquired prior to the Redemption Transaction. A Member may not make more than two redemptions, at any reward level, within one day. Only one redemption is available per Redemption Transaction.</li>
<li>When redeeming Midas points, Midas will automatically select the maximum eligible Midas Points redemption level available. Alternatively, you may select a different eligible redemption level by informing the cashier prior to the Redemption Transaction. In either case, your Account must have the appropriate number of Midas points. For example, if you have accumulated 45,000 Midas points, the maximum redemption level available is 25,000 Midas Points(based on the example redemption schedule referenced above). However, you may elect to redeem only 10,000 points on a $170.00 transaction; in this case the reduction off the purchase price will be $70.00.</li>
<li>If the purchase price is lower than the redemption value of the points, the remaining dollar value will be forfeited. For example, if you have accumulated 45,000 Midas Points and wish to redeem all these points on a transaction with a purchase price of eligible products of $150.00, then the reduction off the purchase price will be $150.00 and the difference between the $250.00 maximum reward discount and the $150.00 discount (i.e. $100.00) will be forfeited. (This example is based on the example redemption schedule referenced above.)</li>
<li>Products and services eligible for Midas points redemption will be posted at http://<a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a> and updated on a periodic basis. Redemption Transactions can only be made in-store and at cash only. </li>
<li>Midas Points may not be collected or redeemed by any person other than the Midas rewards Member. A Member must present his/her Midas Rewards Card when redeeming Midas Points to protect the integrity of the Member's points balance. Proof of Card ownership may be required. Each Member is responsible to ensure that all Personal Information is correct and up-to-date and Midas reserves the right to block redemptions where the Member information is inaccurate or incomplete. Members are entirely responsible for keeping their Account secure.</li>
<li>You must notify Ricktag immediately if your Midas Rewards Card is lost or stolen. Contact us at 1-800-560-4135 to ensure a replacement card is properly issued to the correct person, and that all Midas Points in your Account are accessible only by you. Upon verification of proper identification, a new Member number or Card will be provided to the Member by the Ricktag Customer Service Centre or in-store, respectively. The accumulated unredeemed Midas Points balance shall remain intact.</li>
<li>If a lost Midas Rewards Card is found and used by any other person, all Midas Points relating to purchases made by such other person will be credited to the Member's Account. Midas assumes no liability or responsibility for Midas Points redeemed by any person(s) prior to the notification to the Ricktag Customer Service Centre that the Midas Rewards Card is lost or stolen. Any Midas Points redeemed prior to notification shall be at the Member's risk.</li>
<li>Ricktag will not be liable or responsible in any manner for any tax consequences or any charge imposed by or with the authority of any government, which may flow from any participation in the Midas Rewards Program.</li>
<li>From time to time, Ricktag may advertise or offer exclusive offers to select Members to redeem Midas Points for items other than a discount reward, or receive other benefits or discounts.</li>
<li>Midas Points have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash. Except as permitted from time to time by Midas at <a href="www.ricktag.ca/midas">www.ricktag.ca/midas</a>, Midas Points cannot be assigned, exchanged, sold, traded, bartered, purchased or given by gift or otherwise sold. Any Midas Points so acquired are void. The accumulation of Midas Points does not entitle the Program Members to any vested rights, and Midas and/or the Program Partners do not guarantee in any way the continued availability of any reward, redemption level, rebate or any other benefit. Ricktag assumes no liability to Members as regards the addition or deletion of Program Partners or of items for which Midas Points can be collected and/or redeemed.</li>
<li>In the event of a "Sale" of the Midas franchise that enrolled you into the Midas Rewards Program, Program Members will be notified by email or by mail and be given 60 days to redeem their Midas Points in-store or the members points will be forfeited.</li>

<h2>Gift Cards</h2>
<li>For all purchased gift cards, card holders will have 12 calendar months to use the full value of the card. After the 12 months is up, a $5/month service fee will apply until the value on card totals $0.00.</li>
<li>Promotional gift cards have no true cash value and are used as a promotional device and it is up to the Midas owner to honor them. </li>
<li>In the event of a "Sale" of the Midas franchise that enrolled you into the Midas Rewards Program, it is up to the new owner to continue to honor the promotional gift cards.</li>
