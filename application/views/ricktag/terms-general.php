<h2><a name="programoverview">Program Overview</a></h2>

<ol style="padding-left: 10px;">

<li>Ricktag Points may be awarded retroactively if the original receipt and your Ricktag Rewards Card is produced in-stores within 14 days of the date of the original Eligible Purchase.</li>
<li>Ricktag Points will be awarded at the rate decided by the Merchant which will be listed on <a href="www.ricktag.ca">www.ricktag.ca</a>. Ricktag Points for each dollar spent on Eligible Purchases.

<li>Ricktag's standard Return/Exchange Policy applies.

Discrepancies must be addressed with the Ricktag Rewards Customer Service Centre within three months of the date on which the discrepancy occurred. Ricktag reserves the right to restrict redemption or put a "hold" on Ricktag Points for up to 90 days from the date the points are posted to an Account if Ricktag has reasonable belief that fraud has occurred or in the event of a breach or suspected breach of the Terms and Conditions of this Program.</li>
<li>Ricktag Points are not transferable from one Member to another. Ricktag may, however, in its sole discretion allow the transfer of Ricktag Points in accordance with the "transfer points" terms and conditions posted from time to time at <a href="www.ricktag.ca">www.ricktag.ca</a></li>

If a Member's only activity in 12 consecutive calendar months consists of transferring points under any Ricktag promotion in existence from time to time, the membership will be deemed inactive and all accumulated Ricktag Points will be forfeited.</li>

  <span style="font-size:10px">25 points is the minimum number of points that can be redeemed and up to 250 points <br/>
is the maximum that members can redeem in a single transaction.
</span>
</div>
<br /><br />
Points will not be awarded on the portion of the Redemption Transaction paid for by redemption of Ricktag points. From time to time, special promotions may be run during which one or more redemption level(s) may temporarily be altered and/or suspended, new redemption levels added or points may be redeemed directly towards the purchase of specific products or services. Promotions may vary from Store to Store and online.

(b) Ricktag may, from time to time, offer supplementary programs, rewards, benefits or promotions related to the Ricktag rewards program.

</li>
<li>In accordance with Federal and Provincial tax legislation, GST, PST, HST and any other applicable taxes are calculated and payable by the Member on the full amount of the purchase price of the item subject to a dollar discount reward during a Redemption Transaction.</li>
<li>Subject to section 29, a Member's Ricktag Points balance will be reduced by the number of points required to obtain the desired point redemption level. Unredeemed Ricktag Points plus any Ricktag Points awarded in the current Redemption Transaction will remain in the Member's Ricktag Rewards Account and can be applied to a subsequent Redemption Transaction.</li>
<li>Ricktag Points can only be redeemed if the required point redemption level is acquired prior to the Redemption Transaction. A Member may not make more than two redemptions, at any reward level, within one day. Only one redemption is available per Redemption Transaction.</li>
<li>When redeeming Ricktag points, Ricktag will automatically select the maximum eligible Ricktag Points redemption level available. Alternatively, you may select a different eligible redemption level by informing the cashier prior to the Redemption Transaction. In either case, your Account must have the appropriate number of Ricktag points. For example, if you have accumulated 450 Ricktag points, the maximum redemption level available is 250 Ricktag Points(based on the example redemption schedule referenced above). However, you may elect to redeem only 100 points on a $170.00 transaction; in this case the reduction off the purchase price will be $100.00. </li>
<li>If the purchase price is lower than the redemption value of the points, the remaining dollar value will be forfeited. For example, if you have accumulated 450 Ricktag Points and wish to redeem all these points on a transaction with a purchase price of eligible products of $150.00, then the reduction off the purchase price will be $150.00 and the difference between the $250.00 maximum reward discount and the $150.00 discount (i.e. $100.00) will be forfeited. (This example is based on the example redemption schedule referenced above.)</li>
<li>Products and services eligible for Ricktag points redemption will be posted at <a href="www.ricktag.ca">www.ricktag.ca</a> and updated on a periodic basis. Redemption Transactions can only be made in-store and at cash only.</li>
<li>Ricktag Points may not be collected or redeemed by any person other than the Ricktag rewards Member. A Member must present his/her Ricktag Rewards Card when redeeming Ricktag Points to protect the integrity of the Member's points balance. Proof of Card ownership may be required. Each Member is responsible to ensure that all Personal Information is correct and up-to-date and Ricktag reserves the right to block redemptions where the Member information is inaccurate or incomplete. Members are entirely responsible for keeping their Account secure.</li>
<li>You must notify Ricktag immediately if your Ricktag Rewards Card is lost or stolen. Contact us at 1-800-560-4135 to ensure a replacement card is properly issued to the correct person, and that all Ricktag Points in your Account are accessible only by you. Upon verification of proper identification, a new Member number or Card will be provided to the Member by the Ricktag Rewards Customer Service Centre or in-store, respectively. The accumulated unredeemed Ricktag Points balance shall remain intact.</li>
<li>If a lost Ricktag Rewards Card is found and used by any other person, all Ricktag Points relating to purchases made by such other person will be credited to the Member's Account. Ricktag assumes no liability or responsibility for Ricktag Points redeemed by any person(s) prior to the notification to the Ricktag Rewards Customer Service Centre that the Ricktag Rewards Card is lost or stolen. Any Ricktag Points redeemed prior to notification shall be at the Member's risk.</li>
<li>Ricktag will not be liable or responsible in any manner for any tax consequences or any charge imposed by or with the authority of any government, which may flow from any participation in the Ricktag \ rewards program.</li>
<li>From time to time, Ricktag may advertise or offer exclusive offers to select Members to redeem Ricktag Points for items other than a discount reward, or receive other benefits or discounts.</li>
<li>Ricktag Points have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash. Except as permitted from time to time by Ricktag  at www.Ricktag .ca, Ricktag Points cannot be assigned, exchanged, sold, traded, bartered, purchased or given by gift or otherwise sold. Any Ricktag Points so acquired are void. The accumulation of Ricktag Points does not entitle the Program Members to any vested rights, and Ricktag and/or the Program Partners do not guarantee in any way the continued availability of any reward, redemption level, rebate or any other benefit. Ricktag assumes no liability to Members as regards the addition or deletion of Program Partners or of items for which Ricktag Points can be collected and/or redeemed.</li>
<li>In the event of a "Sale" of a Ricktag Merchant business, Program Members will be notified by email or by mail and be given 60 days to redeem their Ricktag Points in-store or the members points will be forfeited.</li>

<h2><a name="giftcards">Gift Cards</a></h2>
<li>Gift card holders will have 12 calendar months to use the full value of the card.
